things to do:

fake rat connector, test ch/chip/etc
	test chip by reverse red/blue
help jingjie's final presentation, sorting figs
	more results, etc
read raster
	is there easy way to make it by trial?
change wrapper, tempate,etc
	think about data structure
	ask about database, would be lot of easier with db
	file name etc
go home and get the sausage, before 6
plot of learning
3 tyhpe of tuning, strong for 1 dir
only lef or right, only up, down, strange. should be prob with not enought directions, maybe just boarder tunign curve.



tunig gradually change when cue. 150 200ms, maybe too slow? check with other papers

updated monday:

ephys cable connector
decid if raw data not perfect or sorting not perfect
	check summary of raw data
	std,mean, median .. etc
intergrate raster in daemon
	also mksure has writing permission
	saving mat

check saving path thing
check if can have a standard to cluster cell from different day
	need to have mat saved
new raster plot, 









potential research areas
	sensory stuff
		vision
		hearing
		olfactory/taste
		somatic
	perferably, vision, and on perception/cognitive level
	method, ephys,fmri,modeling of neuron, circuits, cog
	
	above are bio realistic,
	maybe pure computational?
	vision perception model, non bio realistic
		3d vision and depth
		pattern, edge stuff
		low level vision, attention, may go back to biorealistic	
	
	learning n memory
		goes back to where im at before
		cell/molecular, but with modeling
		behavioral modeling, with phamocology manipulation,
			or with ephys etc

	relate to computation but not pure ones
		cant validate, etc

notes
monkey only one direction, fire.
ours, seems change in selectivity

suggest, look at viol trials, compare if no fire etc

sx directions, 
sohortly after the cue onset, fire. bar, sig diff
other type of neurons, fire before cue onset, predicting the subgoal?
two peaks, end of going the subgoal, pause, then move again
after cue onset, as init of movement
near the end of movement, inhibition? stop the move? oppo direction
firing after subgoal, goal only?
less fire duing movemnt, 

same PSTH keep the fomula

pick thetime with most selectivity

look at the population tuning?

3 tyhpe of tuning, strong for 1 dir
only lef or right, only up, down, strange. should be prob with not enought directions, maybe just boarder tunign curve.

tunig gradually change when cue. 150 200ms, maybe too slow? check with other papers





task need time perception,
related to stress

verbal or not

perception rely on report or jseed the result
verbal,no need for training
subject reproduce th time, or report the time

interval, own way to count ??

two task, time perception shouwlb e differnt
one should be shorting and one longer, so can take abg
filled, more acurage, maybe some stimuli to distinguish from timings?or just more attention

vision stimulus, for long 60 timing task, oc not audio


main probs, 
counting, just cant stop
no counting, very bad sense of time
not enough interval, adds up

more task, coutn/noncount, more intervals

conclusion,
allow counting
shorter intervals, seems linear, and estimite the 64s long itv



q title
memory allocation

2bit, +-
decay, feedback,input
and to final 

matrix as intput
ndim, 2bit, just 2
sequence, as another dim

why8point
4 orginal input, and 4 other stable locations in another plane

b, unique, h, try to get a best solution, repeat, to the target



working mmeory

single neuron model, decau muh shorter then working mmeoyr of secnods

prev, add a wr input, but exp scale
now, Wpos, derivative correction the exp decress or incres


triplet,stdp
